# The Electric Car Uptake Calculator 🚘

This project formed part of the winning entry for Code First Girls' Sustainability Challenge 2022! 🥇 👩🏼 🌍  
...and represents my first foray into AI and ML. 🧠 

What does it do?  
The 'calculator' takes input from the user, allowing them to choose a European country and year. 
It uses a linear regression ML algorithm to create a forecast for that country's uptake in electric vehicles.
